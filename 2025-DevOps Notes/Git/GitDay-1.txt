Source code Repository tools
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Guys now see here! In a project one developer will be available or multiple developer will be available?

Ans is multiple developers will be working in side a project.

Now multiple developers will be working in a project

show the Paint diagram 

Devteam is nothing but set of or group of developers will be available in order to develop the project

all the developers will work in the same location or all the developers will work on different locations?

ans: developers will work from different different locations but they are working on the same project

now if you take a any project now you see a project called MakeMyTrip application available  

www.makemytrip.com

MakeMyTrip having different different functionalities flights booking available , hotels booking available, homestays,
trains, buses, cabs and charterflights like this .! different different functionalities are available .. some 
developer is working on flights functionality and another developer is working on the trains functionality and another
developer is working on the cabs functionality but the code should be integrated at one place that code repository
comes into the picture
OK source code repository comes into the picture

now the 1st developer will communicate with source code repository and second developer also communicate with source 
code repository, 3rd and 4th developer also communicate with source code repository.

Every developer will connect with the source code repository for the code integration purpose

developers has done the coding whatever they develop and stored it into repository server.source code will be stored into repository server
now how to work with this repository server there are several repository servers are available

this will show it to students:

--> Multiple developers will work for project development

--> Developers will be working from multiple locations

--> All developers code should be store at one place(Code Integration Should Happen)

--> To integrate all the developers source code at one place we will use source code repository software's



after Source repository Diagram on paint will explain this
who, when what after

all these things we can monitor for the project source code because source code is very important

developers are keep there blood to write the source code .. writing source code is very diffecult and development
is very difficult guys they are going to keep lot of efforts to write the code

Assume that I am developer yesterday I my code is working successfully but today my code is not working because some 
body modified that code.
do I need to find out who modified my code or not? Guys come on ...

 Yesterday my code was working successfully but today morning my code is not working the reason is some body 
modified my code.. 
do I need to find out who modified my code or not? 
ans: Yes that means monitored access for my code
